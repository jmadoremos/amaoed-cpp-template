This documentation contains the instructions to install, configure and get started with C++ programming language in Windows.

## Specifications

* The [MinGW-w64](#mingw-w64) contains the required utility executables to compile and debug the application, the standard C and C++ libraries, and other files.

* The [git](#visual-studio-code-with-git-and-github) will be used to clone and interact with git repositories.

* The [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code-with-git-and-github) will be the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) endorsed for the entire course.

1. Go to this template repository's root folder and then click the "Use this template" button, or just click [this link](https://github.com/kurozawa6/amaoed-cpp-template/generate).

2. Fill out the Create a new repository form as desired.

3. Clone the newly made repository locally. One of the many ways to do this is by first clicking "Code" and then copying the HTTPS link.

4. Open Visual Studio Code. If there's already an active open folder, open a new folder via CTRL + SHIFT + N.

5. Go to Explorer or Source Countrol by clicking its respective button (usually at the top left) or via CTRL + SHIFT + E or CTRL + SHIFT + G.

6. Click "Clone Repository".

8. To try compiling and running a sample program, go to the src/sample folder and click main.cpp.

9. Click "Run" and then "Run Without Debugging" or press CTRL+F5.

10. You should now see the program run in the integrated terminal. If you don't see it, make sure the active tab is "TERMINAL" and not "DEBUG CONSOLE.
