##### Homebrew

Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didnâ€™t.

> For more information, see [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) homepage.

> **Important:** This comes pre-installed in OSX. If using OSX, skip to the [Docker Desktop](#docker-desktop) step.

To install, run this command using Terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

##### Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment that lets you build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices.

> For more information, see [Overview of Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) documentation from Docker Inc.

To install, follow these instructions:

   1. Using any internet browser, navigate to the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) homepage.
   2. Click the **Download for Mac** button.
   3. In your **Downloads** folder, double-click the installer file.
   4. Follow the installation process. Generally, you just have to click the **Next** button until the installation is complete. There is no need for customizations.
