##### Homebrew

Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didnâ€™t.

> For more information, see [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) homepage.

To install, run this command using any terminal:

##### GNU Compiler Collection

The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, D and Modula-2 as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom.

To install, run this command using any terminal:
