## Getting Started

This git repository requires an initial setup to maximize learning experience. There are two methods available for the setup:

- **Dev Container** uses a virtualized environment and is the preferred setup.
- **Bare Metal** uses the host operating system.

**Comparison**

Here is a comparison based on features:

| Feature             | Dev Container                               | Bare Metal                                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Setup Time          | Quick and easy, pre-configured environments | Time-consuming, manual installation of tools  |
| Consistency         | Consistent environment across machines      | Environment varies based on machine setup     |
| Portability         | Easy to share and move between machines     | Requires manual configuration on each machine |
| Resource Management | Resource isolation for projects             | Full control over system resources            |
| Learning            | Less hands-on experience with system setup  | Deeper understanding of system configuration  |
| Troubleshooting     | Can be more complex due to containerization | Easier to identify system-specific issues     |

**Dev Container**

These are the advantages of using dev container method:

- **Fast Start:** Get started quickly with pre-configured environments for specific projects.
- **Consistent Development:** Ensures everyone on the project uses the same tools and versions.
- **Easy Collaboration:** Share development environments easily with others.

These are the disadvantages of using dev container method:

- **Limited Control:** Less control over the underlying system compared to bare metal.
- **Troubleshooting Challenges:** Troubleshooting issues can be more complex due to containerization.
- **Resource Overhead:** Containers can add a slight overhead to system resources.

**Bare Metal**

These are the advantages of using bare metal method:

- **Deep Learning:** Gain a deeper understanding of system configuration and dependencies.
- **Full Control:** Have complete control over all system resources.
- **Simpler Troubleshooting:** Easier to identify problems related to the system itself.

These are the disadvantages of using bare metal method:

- **Time-consuming Setup:** Setting up the environment manually can be time-consuming.
- **Inconsistency:** Environments can vary between machines leading to potential issues.
- **Sharing Challenges:** Sharing development environments with others is more complex.

**Instructions**

Dev container offer a faster and more consistent development experience. This allows students to focus on learning programming concepts without getting bogged down in complex system setup. However, as students progress in their studies, exploring a bare metal setup can provide valuable insights into system configuration and troubleshooting.
